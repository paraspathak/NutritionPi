# Hack-UTA

<a href= "https://devpost.com/software/nutritionpy" >Winner of the 2019 HACK UTA Best Hardware Project </a>

A simple solution that allows users to track their food calories by taking a picture of their food

<b>Inspiration</b>

Inspiration for this project was to serve as a self checkout system for buffey restaurant that could take a picture of your plate and figure out your items and charge you accordingly.

<b>What it does</b>

It captures the food image from the connected camera module in raspberry pi. It processes the image using Microsoft's Computer Vision API. Grabs the relevant food's tag and feeds that data in Nutritionix API to get the food's nutrition detail. It takes that nutrition detail and shows on the website.

<b>What's next for NutritionPy</b>

When stuck in a long line at a buffet restaurant, I had an idea of self check out system for the buffet restaurant. This is how we got our inspiration to build a computer application that identifies the food, displays its nutrition, measure its weight and use it to charge you at a self checkout station. This application can also be used to keep track of your daily intake of nutrition by just taking a picture. A daily database of your food can be stored this way.

<b>Built With</b>

Python - Flask, Microsoft VISION API, Nutrionix, HTML, CSS, JS
